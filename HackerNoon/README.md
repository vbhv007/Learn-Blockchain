### This is some content I found on [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

NOTE: This tutorial is only good for getting the jist of blockchain and some important terminology. But don't code along the tutorial because the content is changed on the actual repo from the article. Entire function definations are changed, Hence it's not worth it.
